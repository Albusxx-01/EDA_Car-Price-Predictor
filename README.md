# 🏷️ Quikr Data Analysis Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Quikr listings data to understand pricing trends, category distribution, and factors affecting product prices on the platform.  

The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from real-world classified ads data and visualize patterns related to price, category, location, and product usage.

## 💾 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains product listings from Quikr, including information such as:
- Product category
- Product price
- Location
- Usage condition
- Other listing attributes

The dataset was cleaned and processed to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for meaningful analysis.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing and null values
- Converted price columns to numeric format
- Cleaned inconsistent text data
- Filtered invalid or unrealistic values

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis answers several important questions, supported by visualizations:

- Distribution of products across different categories
- Price distribution of listings
- Most common product categories on Quikr
- Relationship between product usage and price
- Location-wise listing trends
- Identification of high-value and low-value listings

Various plots such as bar charts, histograms, and count plots were used to visualize trends clearly.
